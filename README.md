## General info

Vanilla JS app for creating and managing to-do lists. Also allows registering/signing in and then saving todo-lists under one's profile. Front-end on GitHub Pages, back-end and database on Heroku.

My own idea  ![ðŸ¤“](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f913), created from scratch.  ![ðŸ”¨](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f528)

Live preview [here](https://suavek85.github.io/Annual-Planner/). Inspired by my [earlier project](https://suavek85.github.io/Weekly-Planner-Extra/).

## Features

- creating to-do lists for single selected days,

- creating to-do lists for multiple days at once with the same to-do,

- accessing to-do list for editing, adding/removing to-dos, marking as done, or filtering

- registering, signing in and saving results (saved automatically on each change and loaded on next visit after signin)

- access to weather and upcoming holidays sections
